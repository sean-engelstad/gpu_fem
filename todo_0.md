## Current task priorities
* for geom programming 2.1 and 2.2
* make ppt for Monday meeting 3/3/2025 (show results from sec 1)
    * MELD, iterative solver, speedup kernels (launch params and # elems per block)
* for NASA scalable structures 1.1 and 1.2

## High-level tasks
### 1 - NASA scalable structures (aeroelastic solve, May deadline)
1. [ ] **(1.1)** fast GMRES, ILU(k), qordering vs RCM iterative solves
2. [ ] **(1.2)** demo geom NL static analysis with Newton and Riks methods
3. [ ] **(1.3)** put VLM solver on GPU (Dr. K said be careful - may not be best use of time)
4. [ ] **(1.4)** demo aeroelastic analysis with MELD, TACS, VLM

### 2 - for geometric programming paper
1. [ ] **(2.1)** implement derivatives of linear static analysis
2. [ ] **(2.2)** demo structural optimization with unstiffened panels
3. [ ] **(2.3)** demo GEP + FSD methods on unstiffened wing
4. [ ] **(2.4)** implement stiffened 

### 3 - for parametric ROMs paper
1. [ ] **(3.1)** put VLM solver on the GPU (repeat task) (Dr. K said maybe don't do this - may not be best use of time)
2. [ ] **(3.2)** demo aeroelastic ROM with VLM + TACS GPU
3. [ ] **(3.3)** implement derivatives of linear static, MELD, VLM
4. [ ] **(3.4)** demo optimization with trust region and aeroelastic coupled ROMs
