# Low-Level TODO List
* "todo_1.md" is all low-level tasks for the current high-level task
*Type Ctrl+Shift+V to view in VScode to view markdown*

* current task is derivatives of structural optimization for tasks 2.1 and 2.2 of geometric programming paper
* 2.1: implement derivatives of linear static analysis
* 2.2: demo structural optimization with unstiffened panels

Low-level tasks are:
- [ ] compute stresses
- [ ] compute KS failure scalar for unstiffened panels
- [ ] compute mass routine
- [ ] function objects
- [ ] design variable objects
- [ ] evalFunctions routine
- [ ] evalDVSens routine
- [ ] df/du for functions to adjoint RHS
    - [ ] just for KSfailure
- [ ] partial f/partial x of KSfailure (not total derivative)
- [ ] df/dx for
