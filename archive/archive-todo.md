* some tasks that are unfinished will still do, but remaking TODO list

- [x] linear solver to work on GPU
    - [x] try Dr. K sparse_utils library (git) for sparse factorization
- [x] fix apply_mat_bcs kernel
    - [x] speed it up from 78 seconds to 200 microseconds
    - [x] need to fix kmat, somehow slightly wrong
- [ ] additional verification cases and show mesh convergence
    - [ ] transverse plate mesh convergence, seems a bit weird right now.. (disp not convergent)
        * I noticed a slight asymmetry in K Matrix => check assembly again.. (this bug may mess up mesh convergence)
        * Tim says look at distributed load case for mesh convergence study..
        * apply fillin reordering to speedup linear solve a lot (fewer nnz) acc. Dr. K
        * is this solver issue? or problem with matrix (or fillin)
        * got an illegal memory access with 300 x 300 plate in GPUassert error? is this related?
        * why were plate loads a 0 vec in the plot of 100x100 plate? (just plot artifact)
        - [ ] verify matrix, rhs, solution against TACS CPU for this
- [ ] additional linear solve work to do
    - [ ] reordering, speedup fillin?
    - [ ] make CSR matrices for comparison?
    - [ ] BSR iterative solves with incomplete ILU preconditioner?

- [x] make a CPU linear solver for BSR first, and that way I can have additional debugging level in C++
- [x] speedup BC kernel if needed?
- [x] verify linear solve of plate with sin-sin loads on 5 x 5 rect mesh
    - [x] it runs the solve now, but gives wrong answer
    - [x] verify same kmat (fixes with sorting elem_conn => better way to do this?)

### Performance Improvements
From Kevin:
- [ ] somtimes want to specify unusual launch parameters like 34 threads per block is optimal after checking on your device (not always multiple of 32)
- [ ] Do warp shuffle before adding into shared (adds among threads first with reduction) => this reduces number of atomic adds
- [ ] CUDA asynchronous shared memory load (look it up in performance guide)
Other:
- [ ] go through add residual, add jacobian of shell element => compute as many things on the fly as possible store minimum amount of data.
for example, compute transpose of matrix in some cases so columns available as rows now in consecutive memory. etc.
- [ ] show this approach of computing on the fly is X amount faster than doing it without that.. or show in ppt very well
- [ ] NVIDIA profiling of add residual, add jacobian kernels. Send results to Kevin, Ali, Dr. K
- [ ] profile on GPU best ways to interp tying strain (time that part only). Maybe make small script to test this out..
- [ ] compare computing then storing interpolation vecs N[i] in basis on GPU vs. procedurally getting each N(i) value in a loop using method call for that entry.
