# Cylinders

* Expect cylinders to have more realistic (non min bandwidth matrix) than plate where qordering and RCM might be useful
* also cylinders use nonlinear buckling and nonlinear static analysis in their design (I had a previous paper on thermal buckling and KDFs for cylinders), so this is a good example for the NASA CFD workshop

Goals:
- [ ] demonstrate cylinder performance for different solvers, reorderings
- [ ] demo nonlinear static analyses with and without imperfections
