Developing my own custom version of CQUAD9 shell from ANS-CI (but no CI interp modifications)
* novelty in my shell element is the same FEA basis used for shear and disp interp
* but shear strains are now DOF to remove thin plate algebraic constraint from the PDEs


* NOTE : would shear strains really generalize well with directors? That is unclear.. May not, need more thinking about this..
