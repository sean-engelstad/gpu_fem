# Q ordering a la K. Jacobson
- [ ] [Anderson and K. Jacobson, Node Numbering for Stabilizing Preconditioners Based on Incomplete LU Decomposition](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2020-3022)
    * need to read this and get this to work
    * Q ordering matrix-reordering strategy that reduces the occurence of preconditioner instabilities from incomplete LU => allowing a Krylov subspace method to solve hte linear systems (previously unsolvable)
    * Q ordering greatly increases the robustness and reliability of simulations
    * concerns large linear systems for fluids and structures applications, with iterative Krylov-subspace methods used
    * baseline example : turbulent FUN3D with stabilized finite element solver, with Newton method for nonlinear solve, GMRES for linear solve with ILU(k) preconditioner as in Saad
    * elimination phase of ILU[k] is unstable, resulting in poor iterative method convergence for ILU(0) to ILU(3), but converges for ILU(4) and up
    * looks at magnification of error in the back-solve / triangular solve of the ILU preconditioner
