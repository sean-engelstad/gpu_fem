# How to Optimize Register usage

* need scalar addresses, it appears vector declarations like:
T pt[2]
results in allocation in local meomry with global address space (high number of cycles to read memory). So I would need to do something like this:
T xi, eta;
* how do I handle clearly array data like:
T etn[Basis::num_nodes]
Maybe I put this array in shared memory?
And then I can write and read to it?
Want really low number of array usage with local / global memory apparently.

## Motivation for looking at register usage very carefully
* commenting out methods that do almost nothing but use a global memory array result in huge increase by 104 registers
    * example 1: for drill strain kernel: with method ShellComputeDrillStrainSensV3, if I comment this out it results in about 100 fewer registers and 8x speedup approx in the code
    * example 2 : for tying strain kernel: if I comment out the method addInterpTyingStrainTransposeLight, then I reduce registers by 104 and runtime speeds up by 8x. Don't really know why
    * still I don't see huge speedup I would expect versus CPU probably because I'm using lots more local device memory than I want (which stored globally, this is weird why it's called that). I think this is because I use a bunch of arrays that become global memory and are slow to access. I could make some of these shared memory.. and then make pointers to them for local operations (temporary), but still best to rely on registers as much as possible I think..
* I thought I was using all shared and registers, but that is not the case, generating ptx files helped me realize I need to rethink the way the code is written a lot to speed it up more.
* I probably want to speedup my apply_bcs vec and mat too if possible..
